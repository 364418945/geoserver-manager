## Intro
Client library written in Java to interact with [GeoServer](http://www.geoserver.org) through its [ReST administration interface](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/rest/api/index.html).

The purpose of this project is to hold a ReST client library to interact with GeoServer; a requirement for this library is to depend as less as possible on external libraries. This library aims at being lean and mean.
